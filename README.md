# linux-dotfiles
This is where I dump all of my dotfiles, I'll try to keep it as neat as possible!
Below is what my current setup looks like. I cannot promise you that everything will work out of the box!

### dunst
![alt text lol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liverbrain/linux-dotfiles/master/dunst.png) <br />
Still a massive work in progress, uses [CozetteVector](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette) as the font
### i3
![alt text lol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liverbrain/linux-dotfiles/master/i3.png)
i3 is the window manager I use. No dependencies for this, the keybindings are pretty much all the same as the defaults. See the paragraph on compton for compositing effects
### polybar
![alt text lol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liverbrain/linux-dotfiles/master/polybar.png) <br />
You'll need the [rissole](https://addy-dclxvi.github.io/post/bitmap-fonts/) font for polybar and [CozetteVector](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette) for my polybar icons
You'll also need mpd (and probably mpc) for the music controls
### ranger

My ranger file manager config. Also a work in progress.
### rofi

My rofi currently looks like this. It uses the [CozetteVector](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette) font
### zathura
![alt text lol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liverbrain/linux-dotfiles/master/zathura.png) <br />
My PDF viewer, no transparency yet!
### compton
In order to achieve the blur effect in the preview, you'll need a certain fork of compton called [compton-tryone](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git/)
